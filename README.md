I am writing this for after my death, so that my laptop and user accounts do not fall into the hands of the bastard agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran - because they destroyed my life.

And if this [program] outlives a human being, I am sure that one of the bastards of the Islamic Republic of Iran will use it. My date of birth is 1/27/1994.

I did not even give the real program to these bastards (but a buggy version of this program, along with other software, was stolen by this bastard regime, i.e. they broke into my house and took my laptop and all my belongings).

So far, while I have been alive, I have never seen justice - I do not know what will happen after death.

I gave this program to only one person - the person for whom I developed the software and the MrSanad website - and he has never offered this program to anyone else.

This regime, from judges to lawyers to high-ranking Iranian officials, are thieves and bastards.

Right now, my only wish is to see the heads and hands of all these people - from adults to their children - cut off on the ground. That would be the best day of my life.
